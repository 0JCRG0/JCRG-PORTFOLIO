- Engineered RoleHounds, a web application that combines semantic search with commercial and open-source LLMs to provide personalized and accurate job recommendations using RAG. I used Django, PostgreSQL, HTMX, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5 for the backend and frontend, respectively. The application was deployed on Docker on Digital Ocean.
- Developed a production-grade data pipeline that involved extracting job listings using custom crawlers (Selenium, Scrapy, bs4), standardizing the data using SQL and Python, and implementing efficient vector embedding techniques for retrieval purposes.
- Fine-tuned multiple LLMs with techniques like QLoRA and LoRA to optimize job suitability classification.
- Designed a FastAPI endpoint on Azure Functions to gather user feedback, optimizing LLMs for more precise and personalized job recommendations.
