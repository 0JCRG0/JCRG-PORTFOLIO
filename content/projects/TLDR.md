**TLDR** is an open-source Google Chrome extension designed to demystify the often complex and lengthy _Terms of Service (ToS)_ and _Privacy Policy (PP)_ documents that users encounter on websites.

By harnessing the power of LLMs, **TLDR** automatically activates when a user navigates to a ToS or PP page, processes the text, and generates a concise, easy-to-understand visualization of the key points and implications.

_Inspired by my dissertation [EUâ€™s Transparency Obligations in the Era of AI: Is Transparency Enough to End Privacy Fatigue?](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4695423)_
